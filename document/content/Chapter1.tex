With the rapid growth of online education, quiz-based assessment systems have become an essential
tool for evaluating learner performance.
Platforms such as Quizizz, Google Forms, and similar systems are widely adopted due to their ease
of use and accessibility.
However, these systems primarily focus on static assessment rather than supporting continuous and
personalized learning.

\subsection{Identified Problems}

Through analysis of existing solutions, several key limitations have been identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lack of adaptive difficulty:}
    Most platforms provide a fixed set of questions, ignoring individual learner ability and progress.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited learning feedback:}
    Feedback is often restricted to numerical scores, without explaining learning gaps or misconceptions.
    
    \item \textbf{Manual content creation overhead:}
    Teachers must invest significant time in creating and maintaining large question banks.
\end{itemize}

These problems reduce learning effectiveness and limit the long-term educational value of quiz systems.

\section{Objectives and Scope}

\subsection{Project Objectives}

\label{tab:intro_objectives}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Adaptive assessment & Adjust quiz difficulty based on learner performance \\ \hline
AI-assisted content creation & Automatically generate quiz questions from topics or documents \\ \hline
Enhanced feedback & Provide detailed result analysis and learning insights \\ \hline
Interactive learning & Support real-time quiz sessions and leaderboards \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Project Scope}

The scope of the project is defined as follows:

\begin{description}
    \item[In Scope:]
    Design and implementation of a web and mobile quiz system, AI-based question generation,
    adaptive learning mechanisms, and performance analytics.
    
    \item[Out of Scope:]
    Advanced AI model research, large-scale cloud optimization, and commercial deployment.
\end{description}

\section{Proposed Solution Approach}

    \caption{The Waterfall Model}
    \label{fig:intro_architecture}
\end{figure}

The QuizSpark project follows the \textbf{Waterfall development model}.
System requirements are defined at the beginning of the project and the
development process is conducted through sequential phases, including
requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

Each phase is completed and validated before moving to the next one,
ensuring clear deliverables, stable outputs, and consistency throughout
the project lifecycle.

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}

The application of the Waterfall model is expected to deliver:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A clearly structured and well-documented development process.
    \item Consistency between requirements, design, and implementation.
    \item A stable system that meets the defined project requirements.
\end{itemize}
