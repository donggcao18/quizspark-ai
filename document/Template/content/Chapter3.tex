\section{Architectural Style}

The QuizSpark system adopts a \textbf{three-tier architectural style} combined with a \textbf{microservice approach} for AI functionalities. This architecture is widely utilized in modern web-based systems because it ensures a clear separation of concerns, high scalability, and ease of maintenance.

\end{figure}

At a high level, the system is organized into three primary tiers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Tier:} This layer includes web and mobile clients that provide intuitive user interfaces for students, teachers, and administrators.
    \item \textbf{Application Tier:} This tier serves as the core of the system, responsible for handling business logic, processing user requests, and coordinating interactions between various components.
    \item \textbf{Data Tier:} This layer manages persistent data storage, including sensitive user information, quiz databases, and comprehensive learning analytics.
\end{itemize}



Furthermore, the system integrates an \textbf{AI Engine} implemented as a dedicated microservice. This microservice handles computationally intensive tasks, such as automatic question generation and adaptive learning recommendations. It communicates with the main backend server through well-defined \textbf{RESTful APIs}, allowing the AI component to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently from the rest of the architecture.
